# rat-template
This project is for MacOS only.<br />
**I will be developing a linux version when I get home from vacation.**<br />

# About
This is a better obfuscated python script that runs a "remote access trojan" (Not actually harmful to your PC).<br />
This project does not harm your computer, it's moreso just a template for how an obfuscated remote access trojan / ransomware would work.<br />
This bypassed the antivirus for my school laptop, so I don't know how it will work on yours.
