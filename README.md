# python-malware-obfuscation
This project is (currently) for MacOS only.<br />
**I will be developing a linux version in a few days when I get home from vacation.**<br />

# About
This is a obfuscated python script that runs a "remote access trojan" (Not actually harmful to your PC).<br />
This project does not harm your computer, it's moreso just an example of what obfuscated python malware would look like.<br />
**This project is "disguised" as a python script for bash ascii conversion.** (Social engineering lol)
